If you don't already have a HiggsCombine (with CombineHarvester) installation in CMSSW_8_1_0, run the steps in `environment_installation.sh`\
\ Run the individual sections one at a time in case one of the installation steps throws an error (which can happen!)

Copy all the files into your working directory, inside `CMSSW_8_1_0/src/HiggsCombine`

Run the commands inside `combine_commands_aTGC.sh`\
\ At least one step currently requires some hand-editing (changing the workspace name in the datacard), so unless you're very familiar with the steps, be sure to run them one at a time and read all the comments.
